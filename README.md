**Predicting Vaccine Uptake - Model Evaluation**

This repository contains code for evaluating various machine learning models to predict vaccine uptake based on data collected from the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted by the CDC. The goal is to forecast the probabilities of individuals contracting the H1N1 virus and receiving their seasonal flu vaccine.

**Problem Statement:**

Anticipate the likelihood of individuals contracting H1N1 and receiving their yearly flu vaccine. This entails forecasting two probabilities: one for vaccine_h1n1 and one for vaccine_seasonal. Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual from the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) conducted by the CDC.

**Dataset Description:**

We were given three datasets for this task: two training datasets and one testing dataset. The training datasets consist of features and labels, with one containing the training features and the other containing the corresponding training labels. The objective is to predict the probabilities of individuals receiving vaccines based on the features provided in the dataset. The third dataset is used to evaluate the performance of our predictive model.

**Architecture:**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Initial analysis using heatmaps to identify missing values and draw conclusions based on missing value patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the dataset for model training.

3. **Correlating with Real-World Scenarios:** Understanding the dataset in context and drawing logical connections between variables.

4. **Rigorous Data Analysis:** Key observations regarding factors influencing vaccine uptake and their implications.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Applying various machine learning models and ensembling techniques, followed by evaluating their performance using ROC-AUC scores.
